# 👋 Hey there I'm Aaron Woo

## 🤓 About Me
  * I'm a full stack web developer and I especially like JavaScript. I love web development and the problem solving that it requires. I enjoy fully immersing myself in a problem and being able to think deeply and creatively on how to solve it. 
  * I want to further my technical skills by practicing algorithm problems, learning more about data structures (especially linked lists), and keeping a journal logging the things I learn everyday so I can more legitimately track my progress. 
  * Outside of web development I like to go indoor rock climbing 🧗! 

## ⚙️ Skills
  * React.js
  * JavaScript
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Bootstrap 5
  * PostgreSQL
