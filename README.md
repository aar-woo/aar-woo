## 🤓 About Me
  * I'm a full stack web developer that especially likes JavaScript. I love coding and the problem solving and deep thinking that it requires.
  * I am deliberate and passionate about writing clean code 🧼.
  * I want to further my technical skills by practicing algorithm problems, learning more about data structures (especially linked lists), and keeping a journal logging the things I learn everyday so I can more legitimately track my progress. 
  * Outside of web development I like to go indoor rock climbing 🧗! 

## ⚙️ Skills
  * JavaScript
  * React.js
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Bootstrap 5
  * Node.js
  * PostgreSQL
